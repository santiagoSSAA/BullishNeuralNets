# 1. Introduction

## Explain what the project consists of and the main objectives.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a web application using [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs) that can predict future stock prices using a trained machine learning model. The main objective is to build an intelligent web application that allows users to input a stock symbol and receive a prediction of its future price based on historical data.

## Mention prerequisites (knowledge of Python, Flask, TensorFlow, etc.)

This tutorial is ideal for engineering students, software engineers, and AI enthusiasts who have basic knowledge of **Python** and are interested in learning how to combine web development with machine learning techniques. While no prior knowledge of **Flask**, **TensorFlow**, or finance is required, as all necessary concepts will be explained in detail, familiarity with Python programming and a willingness to learn new frameworks and libraries will be beneficial.

*The tutorial will guide you through the process of obtaining historical stock data, preprocessing and cleaning the data, building and training a neural network model using TensorFlow, creating a Flask web application to interact with the model, implementing a user-friendly interface, and finally, deploying the web application to a server for public access.*
