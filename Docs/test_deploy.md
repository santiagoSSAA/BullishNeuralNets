# 7. Testing and deployment

After developing the stock price prediction web application, it's essential to test it thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected and then deploy it to a web server for public access.

## Local testing of the web application

Before deploying the application, it's crucial to perform comprehensive testing in a local development environment. This helps identify and resolve any issues or bugs before making the application available to users.

Here are some steps you can follow for local testing:

**1. Set up a local environment:** Flask provides a built-in development server that you can use for local testing. In your Flask application file, you can start the development server by running the following command:
   
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
This will start the Flask development server and automatically reload the application whenever you make changes to the code.

**2. Test different scenarios:** Test various scenarios and edge cases to ensure your application functions correctly. For example:

- Test with valid and invalid stock symbols
- Test with different date ranges for historical data
- Test with different model configurations and parameters
- Test user interface for responsiveness and accesibility
   
**3. Use debugging tools:** Flask and other python libraries provide various debugging tools and techniques that can help with you indentify and fix issues. For example, you can use the built-in Flask debugger by setting `debug=True` in the `app.run()` function or use the external debugging tool like `pdb` (Python Debugger) or an IDE with debugging capabilities.
   
**4. Write unit tests:** Consider writing unit tests for critical components of your application, such as the data preprocessing functions, model prediction functions and Flask route handlers. Unit tests help ensure that individual components work as expected and make it easier to identify and fix issues.
   
**5. Perform load testing:** If you expect a significant amount of traffic to the web application, consider performing load testing to ensure your application can handle the expected load without performance issues.
   
**6. Test on diferrent browsers and devices:** Test the web application's user interface on different browsers and devices (desktop, mobile, tablets) to ensure it renders and functions correctly across different platforms.

Once you've thoroughly tested your application locally and resolved any issues, **you're ready to deploy it to a web server for public access**.

## Deploy to a web server (e.g. PythonAnywhere)

There are several options for deploying your Flask web application to a web server, including cloud platforms like PythonAnywhere, Heroku, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk. In this section, we'll focus on deploying to PythonAnywhere, a cloud platform that provides a simple and beginner-friendly environment for hosting Python applications.

Here are the steps to deploy your application to PythonAnywhere:

**1. Sign up for a PythonAnywhere account:** Visit the Python Anywhere website (https://www.pythonanywhere.com) and sign up for a new account. You can start with a free "Beginner" account for testing purposes.

**2. Create a new web app:** In the PythonAnywhere dashboard, create a new web app by navigating to the "Web" tab and clicking the "Add a new web app" button. Choose the "Manual configuration" option and select the Python version you used for the application.

**3. Upload your application files:** You can upload your application files to PythonAnywhere using the built-in file editor ir by connection to the PythonAnywhere server using a tool like FileZilla or WinSCP. Make sure to upload all the neccessary files, including your Flask application file, HTML templates, static files (CSS, Javascript), and any other required files or directories.

**4. Configure the web app:** In the PythonAnywhere dashboard, navigate to the "Web" tab and click on the web app you created earlier. Scroll down to the "Code" section and endter the path to your Flask application file (e.g., `/home/santiagossaa/myapp/app.py`). You may also need to configure the virtual enviroment or install any required packages using the PythonAnywhere console.

**5. Set up a custom domain (optional):** If you want to use a custom domain for your application instead of the default PythonAnywhere URL, ***you can configure a custom domain by following the instructions in the PythonAnywhere documentation.***

**6. Reload the web app:** After making any cconfiguration changes, reload your web app by clicking the "Reload" button in the PythonAnywhere dashboard.

**7. Test your deployed app:** Once the reload process is complete, you can access your deployed application by visiting the URL provided by PythonAnywhere (e.g., `https://your-username.pythonanywhere.com/`)

***By following these steps, you'll have successfully deployed your stock price prediction web application to a web server, making it accessible to users worldwide.***

### Note: It's important to note that PythonAnywhere is just one option for deploying your Flask application. There are many other hosting platforms and services available, each with its own strengths and limitations. You can choose the one that best fits your requirements and budget.
