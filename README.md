BullishNeuralNets are neural networks trained in a 100% bullish environment, creating perpetually optimistic algorithms for trading. To the moon! 📈

## Description 📖

This project is a tutorial that shows how to create a web app with Python that uses AI to predict stock prices. 🔮 The app combines Flask for the web backend, TensorFlow for the deep learning model, and a financial data API to get market data. A winning recipe!

The main goal is to teach engineering students and software engineers how to integrate AI into a web app using popular technologies like Python and TensorFlow. 🚀

## Features 🔥

- **Flask Web App**: A Flask-built web app that allows users to enter a stock symbol and get a prediction of the future price using AI. Guess that price!
- **Deep Learning Model**: A TensorFlow model trained on historical stock price data to generate accurate predictions. 🧠
- **Financial Data API**: Integration with a financial data API to fetch up-to-date stock market data. Fresh data!
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive web interface that makes the app easy to use. 🤳
