## 8. Conclusions and next steps

Throughout this tutorial, you've learned how to create a web application using Python, Flask, and TensorFlow that can predict stock prices using a trained machine learning model. You've gained valuable skills in data collection, preprocessing, model building, web development, and deployment.

### Summary of what was learned

Here's a quick recap of the key topics covered in this tutorial:

**1. Data Collection:** You learned how to obtain historical stock price data using the Alpha Vantage API and how to preprocess and structure the data for use in a machine learning model. 

**2. Building the AI model with TensorFlow:** You gained an understanding of neural networks and their application in time series prediction. You learned how to prepare data for model training, build a neural network model using Tensorflow and train & evaluate the model's performance.

**3. Creating the Web Application with Flask:** you explored the basics of Flask, a Python web framework and learned how to create routes, render HTML templates, and integrate the trained AI model into the application.

**4. UI implementation:** You designed and implemented an attractive and user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS and Javascript, allowing users to input stock symbols and view predictions results dinamically.

**5. Testing and Deployment:** You learned best practices for testing your web application locally and deploying it to a web server (in this case, Python Anywhere) for public access.

### Possible improvements and extensions of the project

While the stock price prediction web application you've built is functional and provides a solid foundation, there are several potential improvements and extensions you could consider:

**1. Improve the model:** Explore more advanced neural network architectures or ensemble models to improve prediction accuracy. You could also incorporate additional features or technical indicators into the model.

**2. Real-time data integration:** Instead of relying solely on historical data, integrate real-time stock data feeds to make predictions based on the latest market information.

**3. User Authentication and Personalization:** Implement user authentication and personalization features, allowing users to create accounts, save their preferences and track their prediction history.

**4. Portfolio Management:** Extend the application to enable users to create and manage their stock portfolios, providing insights and reccomendations based on their holdings.

**5. Sentiment Analysis:** Incorporate sentiment analysis techniques to analyze news, social media, and other textual data sources and use this information to improve stock price predictions.

**6. Visualizations and reporting:** Enhance the user interface by adding interactive visualizations and reporting tools to better understand and analyze prediction results.
