# How to create a web app w/ Python & AI for predicting stock prices
##### By Santiago Sanchez Pulgarin

In this article we will see how to create an MVP using TensorFlow and a financial API in a purely bullish environment.

### [1. Introduction](Docs/introduction.md)

- Explain what the project consists of and the main objectives.
     
- Mention prerequisites (knowledge of Python, Flask, TensorFlow, etc.)

### [2. Environment configuration](Docs/env_conf.md)

- Install Python and the necessary libraries (Flask, TensorFlow, Pandas, Numpy, etc.)

- Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### [3. Data collection](Docs/data_collect.md)

- Explain how to obtain historical stock price data using a financial data API (e.g. Alpha Vantage)
    
- Show how to structure and clean data for use in the AI model

### [4. Building the AI model with TensorFlow](Docs/build_ai_model.md)

- Introduction to neural networks and their application in time series prediction
    
- Preparing data for model training
    
- Building the neural network model with TensorFlow
    
- Model training and evaluation

### [5. Creating the web application with Flask](Docs/create_web_app.md)

- Basic structure of a Flask application
    
- Creating routes and views
    
- HTML Template Rendering
    
- Integration of the trained AI model into the application

### [6. UI Implementation](Docs/ui_creation.md)

- User Interface Design with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    
- Creating a form to enter the symbol of the desired action
    
- Viewing prediction results

### [7. Testing and deployment](Docs/test_deploy.md)

- Local testing of the web application
    
- Deploy to a web server (e.g. PythonAnywhere, Heroku, etc.)

### 8. Conclusions and next steps

- Summary of what was learned
    
- Possible improvements and extensions of the project
    
- Additional resources to continue learning
