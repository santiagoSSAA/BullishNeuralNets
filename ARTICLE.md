# How to create a web app w/ Python & AI for predicting stock prices
##### By Santiago Sanchez Pulgarin

In this article we will see how to create an MVP using TensorFlow and a financial API in a purely bullish environment.

### [1. Introduction](Docs/introduction.md)

    1.a. Explain what the project consists of and the main objectives.
     
    1.b. Mention prerequisites (knowledge of Python, Flask, TensorFlow, etc.)

### [2. Environment configuration](Docs/env_conf.md)

    2.a.  Install Python and the necessary libraries (Flask, TensorFlow, Pandas, Numpy, etc.)

    2.b. Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### [3. Data collection](Docs/data_collect.md)

    3.a. Explain how to obtain historical stock price data using a financial data API (e.g. Alpha Vantage)
    
    3.b. Show how to structure and clean data for use in the AI model

### [4. Building the AI model with TensorFlow](Docs/build_ai_model.md)

    4.a. Introduction to neural networks and their application in time series prediction
    
    4.b. Preparing data for model training
    
    4.c. Building the neural network model with TensorFlow
    
    4.d. Model training and evaluation

### [5. Creating the web application with Flask](Docs/create_web_app.md)

    5.a. Basic structure of a Flask application
    
    5.b. Creating routes and views
    
    5.c. HTML Template Rendering
    
    5.d. Integration of the trained AI model into the application

### [6. UI Implementation](Docs/ui_creation.md)

    6.a. User Interface Design with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    
    6.b. Creating a form to enter the symbol of the desired action
    
    6.c. Viewing prediction results

### [7. Testing and deployment](Docs/test_deploy.md)

    7.a. Local testing of the web application
    
    7.b. Deploy to a web server (e.g. PythonAnywhere, Heroku, etc.)

### 8. Conclusions and next steps

    8.a. Summary of what was learned
    
    8.b. Possible improvements and extensions of the project
    
    8.c. Additional resources to continue learning
